< Today's Progress: > 

Today I started Pico go the first one done for general skills I was able to set up kali linux with WSL and will be running that over the use of the Built in terminal so I can work on some hands on with kali while doing CTFS on Pico and building my tool set.

< Thoughts: >

I need to figure out how to get get the man python to work pn python 3 or find a older versure #noob! but progress will happen 

# Obedient cat
1. copy the url for the flag form  the main page
2. ran wget in ubuntu with the url to get the file in my Pico folder
3. use cat of flag file to reveal the flag

Today I installed Unbuntu on my WSL2 o start working on a tool box to run on ctfs that I can build on the fly if needed. I also watched a video to help fill the gap on what I was missing on the last CTF for python. I was able to figure it out after learning about `chmod`

< Thoughts: >
Need to work on maintaing my list of commands and tools to better help me when im stuck

# Python Wrangling part 2

3. not that I had the files on my system I found that the ende.py file was not executable so I had to use `chmod ende.py` to convert it to a file that can be run with the python command. 
4. I ran `python3 ende.py -d flag.txt.en` this ran the and used a password to run the flag file to decrypt it giving me the flag.
5. Had to watch a video on this was a bit of a mix up because I was un aware of chmod. I made a note on my journal to remember the command if I ever run into this again.
